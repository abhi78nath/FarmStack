              The Crop Advisor utility feature can assist farmers in making
              informed decisions about the best crop to grow. The feature

              various factors such as climate, soil type, and environmental
              factors, which can help optimize yields and minimize losses. The
              software also provides information on best practices for planting,
              harvesting, pest management, and other essential agricultural
              practices, enabling farmers to make better decisions and increase
              their productivity and profitability.

              A land lease system for farming is a contractual agreement between
              a FarmStack and a farmer, where the FarmStack grants the farmer
              the right to use a specific piece of land for agricultural
              purposes in exchange for rent or other agreed-upon terms. This
              arrangement allows individuals or organizations who own land but
              do not wish to farm it themselves to lease it to FarmStack and We
              lease it Farmer who have the knowledge, resources, and desire to
              cultivate the land.

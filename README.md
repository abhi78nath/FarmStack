# FarmStack - Nurturing a Connected Community of Farmers with Innovative Tools
## Objective

At FarmStack, our objective is to revolutionize the way farmers interact, collaborate, and access vital farming resources. We aim to bridge the gap between farmers by providing them with a powerful online platform where they can connect, share, and learn from each other's experiences. Our goal is to empower farmers with advanced tools and information, such as the crop advisor and weather forecast features, to make informed decisions about their farming practices. We also strive to keep farmers updated with the latest government schemes, ensuring they have access to valuable financial support and subsidies. FarmStack's ultimate objective is to improve farmers' livelihoods, boost their productivity, and create a supportive and inclusive farming community that thrives on knowledge-sharing and collaboration. We believe that by leveraging technology, we can address the challenges faced by farmers and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the agricultural sector.

## Methodology

The FarmStack project follows a comprehensive and iterative development methodology to ensure the creation of a robust and user-friendly agritech website.

Based on the requirements gathered, we created a detailed design and planning document. This includes defining the website's architecture, creating wireframes, mockups, and user interface (UI) design elements. We also planned the development process, including the selection of appropriate technologies, frameworks, and tools.

We used the planned approach to start building the website. This includes front-end and back-end development, database design and implementation, integration of third-party APIs such as weather forecast, and implementation of user authentication and authorization for secure access.

This approach ensures the creation of a high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly agrotech website that meets the needs of farmers and supports their interactions, knowledge sharing, and access to valuable resources.
